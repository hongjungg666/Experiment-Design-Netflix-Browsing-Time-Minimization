# Experiment Design: Netflix Browsing Time Minimization

Factorial experiment, hypothesis testing, Family-Wise Error Rate, Bonferroni Correction 
 
## Introduction
Research shows that people may feel it becomes more complex and take longer to make decisions when they face many options, so do Netflix users; this is called decision paralysis. Netflix wants to avoid decision paralysis by helping users choose what to watch quickly. Minimizing usersâ€™ browsing time on the homepage can avoid users losing interest, thus maintaining user retention and increasing conversion rate. Based on this motivation, we ran a series of experiments with different conditions to see which would minimize our metric of interest: the average user browsing time. A Series of Factorial Experiments has been designed, simulated, and evaluated in solving this problem.
